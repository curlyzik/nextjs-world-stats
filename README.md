## Description
This web app is one my favorite projects from my projects catalogue, I'd say. It was really fun building this web app as I got to work work with Nextjs and Tailwind again. The API used for the web app is restcountries.eu It's an "educative" web app that gives statistics about a country. Statistics like, Population, Gini, Area, Capital, Language, Currencies, Native name, Neighbouring Countries are provided. To me, whats unique about this project is that, first of all, I got to use a tool like Nextjs and Tailwind to get this done. Secondly, the UI is completely different from other websites you visit to get statistics about a country. Is not boring at all. It's simple and sleek.
